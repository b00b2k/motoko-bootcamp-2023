Question1: 48gb for stable memory, 4gb heap limit

Question2: the "let" variable doesnt allow for variables to be mutable.
            for the "dapp" to work we'll need to change "let" into "var". 
            we also need to add a semicolon at the end.

Question3: The 0 after the text is not in quotation marks 
            a query function cant change the state of the canister thus the first function needs to remove
            the query. Instead, ... "public func change_message"... should be written
            The return type doesnt specify what variable is returned.
            we also need to add a semicolon at the end again 

Question4: True, we need the keyword "async" to signal the canister that we need to wait for consensus. Query calls don't modify 
            Blockchain, thus we dont have to wait for other nodes
